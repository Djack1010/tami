# DexWave

A modular and customizable DEX obfuscator that defeats image-based Malware Classificator.

This tool implements the methodology of the paper "Perturbation of Image-based Malware Detection with Smali level morphing techniques". The paper also presents an experiment to defeat a CNN image-based classifier. The CNN model was trained with [TAMI](https://github.com/Djack1010/tami).
