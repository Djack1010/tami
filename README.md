# Tami

TAMI (Tool for Analyzing Malware represented as Images) gathers together the code, tools, and approaches presented 
in some publications by Giacomo Iadarola, a PhD student at IIT-CNR and University of Pisa. 

If you are using this repository, please consider [**citing our works**](#publications) (see links at the end of this README file).

---

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing 
purposes. We highly suggest running Tami in a [Docker container](#run_docker), especially to run experiments on the GPU.
Otherwise, you can run Tami in a virtualenv (see Section [virtualenv](#virtualenv)).

### Run in a Docker container 
<a name="run_docker"></a>
> SUGGESTED installation, almost mandatory for experimenting on GPU

You can run TAMI in a container built upon the `tensorflow/tensorflow:2.7.0-gpu` image. This is strongly suggested 
for handling dependencies related to GPU drivers because you only need to install 
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and the [NVIDIA Docker support](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) to 
work with the Tensorflow GPU support (see also [Tensorflow Docker Requirements](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker) 
for further instructions).

You can either (1. **Suggested**) [download](download) the latest image from our cloud or (2.) [build](#build) Tami image locally.

#### Download latest Tami from the cloud
<a name="download"></a>

In the `docker/` folder of this repository, there is a script `download_and_load_image.sh` which downloads the latest 
Tami image from the cloud and load locally the image in docker. Once loaded, you can run it with `run_container.sh`.

Scripts Usage:
> 
> download_and_load_image.sh
> 
> run_container.sh [--no-gpu] [--quantum]

Default execution:
```commandline
docker/download_and_load_image.sh
docker/run_container.sh
```

#### Build Tami locally
<a name="build"></a>

In the `docker/` folder of this repository, there is a Dockerfile that builds the image and installs the requirements 
for TAMI, and two scripts (`build_image.sh` and `run_container.sh`) to handle the docker operations.

Scripts Usage:
> 
> build_image.sh [--quantum]
> 
> run_container.sh [--no-gpu] [--quantum]

Default execution:

```commandline
docker/build_image.sh
docker/run_container.sh
```

##### External tools required for vectorization:

[GIST DESCRIPTOR](https://github.com/tuttieee/lear-gist-python)

The script `install.sh` should take care of the gist descriptor tool integration. If something fails, manually install
the repo:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/tuttieee/lear-gist-python
```

### Run in a Virtualenv
<a name="virtualenv"></a>

##### Tested on Ubuntu 20.04

You can run the script `install.sh` to set up all the necessary dependencies (excluding the GPU ones).
Then, you should install all the necessary libraries with `pip`
```commandline
pip install -r requirements/partial_requirements.txt 
```

---

## Usage

There are 3 scripts that handle Tami executions: `train_test.py` (the main one) `pre_processing.py`, and 
`post_processing.py`. There are more utilities scripts in the `scripts` folder, such as backup data and cleaning up old 
results/logs. Also, the script `main_literature.py` (which is based on the `train_test.py` one) allows to train and 
test a specific set of DL models from the literature (for 'related works' comparison).

### Train and test models

The script `train_test.py` allows training different DL models over a provided dataset. Also, it allows performing model
assessment (through tuning the hyperparameters), save and load trained models, and output graphs and results on the 
training phase.

See further information on the arguments required with:

```commandline

### Prepare the Dataset

The script `pre_processing.py` provides two functionalities:
1. split a set of files into training, validation and test set
2. convert a dataset of files into a dataset of images. 

See further information on the arguments required with:

```commandline
python pre_processing.py --help
usage: python pre_processing.py [-h] -d DATASET [--mode {rgb-gray,rgb,gray,ds}] [--input {generic,apk}] [-p PERCENTAGE] [-v]

Tool for Analyzing Malware represented as Images

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Arguments:
  -d DATASET, --dataset DATASET
                        the dataset path
  --mode {rgb-gray,rgb,gray,ds}
                        Choose which mode run between 'rgb-gray' (default), 'rgb', 'gray', and 'ds'.The 'rgb-gray' will convert the dataset in both grayscale and rgb colours, while
                        the other two modes ('rgb' and 'gray') only in rgb colours and grayscale, respectively.
  --input {generic,apk}
                        Custom image conversion or file split for some file format: -> generic: default, convert/handle the plain file -> apk: extract and convert/handle only the
                        .dex file
  -p PERCENTAGE, --percentage PERCENTAGE
                        Percentage for training, validation, and test set when --mode=ds. FORMAT ACCEPTED = X-Y-Z , which represent the training (X), validation (Y) and test (Z)
                        percentage, respectively. DEFAULT value is 80-10-10
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
```

#### Split dataset

The `--mode=ds` split the input dataset into training, validation and test set. It can be set the percentage of each 
set with `-p <TRAINPERC>-<VALPERC>-<TESTPERC>`. The input dataset **MUST** be in the following folder tree structure:

```
└─ /YOUR_DATASET 	
    ├─ /OUTPUT_CLASS_1
    |   ├─ YOUR_FILE_1
    |   ├─ ...
    |   └─ YOUR_FILE_N
    ├─ ...
    └─ /OUTPUT_CLASS_M
        ├─ YOUR_FILE_1
        ├─ ...
        └─ YOUR_FILE_K
```

The execution will output the dataset in the folder tree structure format required by the other Tami functionalities 
(such as, the input folder tree structure required by the mode `--mode=[rgb-gray|rgb|gray]`, see next doc subsection)

Example: 

```commandline
python pre_processing.py -d <RAW_DATASET> --mode=ds --percentage=80-10-10
```

#### Convert dataset

The `--mode=[rgb-gray|rgb|gray]` converts a dataset of files into a dataset of images. The original files are cast to 
`.png` and converted into RGB or Grayscale pictures (or both). It is required to input a dataset of file splits in a 
folder tree structure such as the following (**HINT**: it is the output of `--mode=ds`):

```
└─ /YOUR_DATASET 	
    ├─ /training
    |   ├─ /train
    |   |   ├─ /OUTPUT_CLASS_1
    |   |   |   ├─ YOUR_FILE_1
    |   |   |   ├─ ...
    |   |   |   └─ YOUR_FILE_N
    |   |   ├─ ...
    |   |   └─ /OUTPUT_CLASS_M
    |   |       ├─ YOUR_FILE_1
    |   |       ├─ ...
    |   |       └─ YOUR_FILE_K
    |   └─ /val
    |       ├─ /OUTPUT_CLASS_1
    |       ├─ ...
    |       └─ /OUTPUT_CLASS_M
    └─ /test
        ├─ /OUTPUT_CLASS_1
        ├─ ...
        └─ /OUTPUT_CLASS_M
```

The number of samples/files for each OUTPUT_CLASS may differ, but the number of OUTPUT_CLASS **MUST** be the same (and 
also consistent with the names) in all the dataset folders (`training/train`, `/traning/val`, and `/test`). See the 
folder tree structure of `DATASET/dataset_test_malware` as an example.

### Analyze the results

The script `post_processing.py` performs operations and analysis over result sets of a previous training phase.
The script has 4 main functionalities:
 * **Gradcam**: applies the Grad-cam on a loaded (and trained) model. Many 'cam' variants are available.
 * **IF/IM-SSIM**: runs IF/IM-SSIM analysis on the heatmaps generated by the Gradcam(s).
 * **DexWave**: performs attack on a trained DL model for image-malware classification. It applies perturbations to the
   input samples to 'trick' the model and produce missclassifications, to drop down the model accuracy and generate 
   malware variants.
 * **Plot-Generator**: creates plot using metrics stored in the .results file obtained after training session.
